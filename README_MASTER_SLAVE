This is master slave implementation using forks. This progeram takes command line args i.e. :

./MasterSlave 3 3 5

where arg 1 is row, arg 2 is column, and arg 3 is the value in the array

So the values can be anything, and it should run. 

Also the created file is in the same directory where the program is, if MasterSlave.c is in Downloads then somefile2.txt will be in Downloads as well.
When program outputs in terminal, it tends to not returm to the prompt, pressing enter will give the prompt.
